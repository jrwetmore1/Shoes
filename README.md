CIDM 3312 Final Project
For the final project you will create an ASP.NET Core application using EF Core. You will combine all the
skills and technologies learned throughout this class into one complete web application.
Your task is to develop an idea for a web application that requires data storage and management, and
implement it using ASP.NET and EF Core with the following requirements:
• You will create your own GitHub repository. There is no GitHub Classroom link.
o On GitHub.com click New Repository. Give your repository a unique name.
o Make your repo Public so I can view it. You can share ideas and collaborate with each
other as long as you all write your own code.
o Create a .gitignore file that contains “bin/” and “obj/”.
• Your web application should have at least TWO database tables implemented as entity classes.
• Follow steps 1-8 from Week 13 to create your ASP.NET Core project with EF Core.
• Use scaffolding (for step 8) on one of your entity classes.
• Write code to display or modify related data. This can’t be scaffolded.
o For example, if you have students and courses the course page should list the students
in the course. Each student page should list the courses that student is in.
o Another example would be to have a button or form for a student to add/drop a course.
• Seed the database with records for all your entities. Ensure that one entity has enough records
(at least 25) to support paging.
• Add Data Validation to all the necessary properties.
• Add paging support to a razor page. For example, list only ten records at a time and allow the
user to navigate to the next and previous pages. Disable the next/prev buttons as appropriate.
• Add a search bar to at least one razor page. Allow the user to type in a search string and show
only those results.
• Allow the user to sort on at least one record both ascending and descending – OR – filter
records using a SelectList.
• Add links to all appropriate pages in the navigation bar.
Deliverables:
• [10 points] Submit a 1 to 2-page description of your idea by Saturday, Nov 18
th at 11:00 PM CT
o What is the name of your web application?
o Describe your idea. What is the purpose of the web application?
o What type of data will it store? What will the tables be and attributes?
▪ Submit an ERD with business rules.
o Submit a Word Document or PDF to the Final Project Idea Submission Drop Box in
WTClass under Lessons➔Final Project.
• [90 points] Complete project is due by Thursday, Dec 7
th at 11:00 PM CT
o Keep pushing changes to your GitHub repo until the deadline.
o Submit a link to your GitHub Repository on WTClass to the Final Project Submission
Drop Box under Lessons ➔ Final Project.
